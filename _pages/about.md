Hi there, I'm currently a second-year Bachelor's student at ITMO University, Russia, majoring in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence.

My research and study interests include Machine Learning, Deep Learning in Computer Vision and NLP, and currently developing efficient applications that solve real-world problems, such as ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) and Image Processing.

I am a minimalist. I've always been drawn to the idea of minimalism, both in terms of design and functionality. For me, the perfect solution is one that does exactly what it needs to do, without any extraneous bells and whistles.


### **About this site**

#### **Personal Story**
While studying at university, I was mostly trained as a Robotics Engineer and learned about subjects such as control theory and optimization. However, as I delved deeper into the field, I found myself becoming more and more curious about the workings of the human brain and how machines could learn from it. This led me to the field of AI, where I could explore the intersection of neuroscience and technology. I'm grateful that I've also developed a quite strong foundation in mathematics and programming. These motivations also led me to create this site, where I can store my own knowledge and share it with the community.

#### **Site information**
This site was formally built in the spring of 2023.

The main purposes of this site are listed here:
- Discuss the mathematics and the technical details of mathematics, machine learning, deep learning problems
- Discuss the latest trends and advancements in technology 
- Present my projects
- Record my personal achievements
